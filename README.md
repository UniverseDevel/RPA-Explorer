# RPA Explorer

Graphical explorer for RenPy Archives. This tool brings ability to extract, create new or change existing RPA archives all in one window. It also provides content preview for most common files in these packages. Initial parser code was inspired by [RPATools](https://github.com/Shizmob/rpatool), so in case you find this tool useful, go give them a thumbs up as well. Now it even can try to preview compiled RenPy files (conditions apply, see <sup>[[1]](#reference1)</sup>).

#### Note:

This is a fan made application and there is no guarantee of further development or fixes. For video support LibVLC library is used and this library has ~300MiB in size so this is the reason why this application is so big, I haven't found a better way around this yet.

### Supported file types for preview:

- Text: py, rpy~, rpy, txt, log, nfo, htm, html, xml, json, yaml, csv
- Video: 3gp, flv, mov, mp4, ogv, swf, mpg, mpeg, avi, mkv, wmv, webm
- Audio: aac, ac3, flac, mp3, wma, wav, ogg, cpc
- Images: jpeg, jpg, bmp, tiff, png, webp, exif, ico, gif
- Compilations<sup>[[1]](#reference1)</sup>: rpyc~, rpymc~, rpyc, rpymc

### TODO List:

[TODO.md](https://github.com/UniverseDevel/RPA-Explorer/blob/master/TODO.md)

### Known Issues:

- When selecting/unselecting objects too fast will not update selections for child or parent objects, this seems to be a TreeView bug/shortcomming and there is not much I can do with it.
- Some video/audio formats will not update time played or total video time and this seems to be LibVLC library issue.
- When browsing trough videos, after some time (and after some ammount of videos loaded) application freezes. So far I am unable to tell if I am handling objects incorrectly or it is a LibVLC problem.
